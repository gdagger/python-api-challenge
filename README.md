Module 6 Challenge

All coding and analysis is provided in the VacationPy.ipynb and WeatherPy.ipynb Jupyter Notebook files contained in this repository. The directory "output_data" PNG files exported from the Jupyter notebook, including the scatter plots from the WeatherPy section, as well as the cities data and hotel maps.

I used my own API keys for OpenWeatherMap and Geoapify to complete this assignment.
